Given a rectangular grid of uppercase letters, find a rectangular region of the grid of maximum possible area such that there is a horizontal palindrome spanning some row of the rectangular region and a vertical palindrome spanning some column of the rectangular region.
Recall a palindrome is a string that equals its own reversal.

\section*{Input}

The first line contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \leq R,C \leq 500$). Then next $R$ lines describe the grid,
each containing exactly $C$ uppercase letters.

\section*{Output}
Output a single integer $A$ indicating the largest area of a rectangular region of the grid 
such that there is a horizontal palindrome spanning some row and a vertical palindrome spanning some column of the rectangular region.
