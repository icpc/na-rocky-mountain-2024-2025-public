Congratulations!
Your team has advanced to the next round of the International Cupcake Production Competition (ICPC)!
%
To participate in the competition, you are going to fly to Cupcake City from your hometown.
The competition organizers have just shared good news:
generous sponsors will support you with your flight ticket!

Here's how it works.
%
You have already obtained a list of available flights.
%
Among those options, you first report the price of any one potential flight.
This determines the \emph{reimbursement limit} of your trip; sponsors would pay you \emph{up to half that price}.
%
Next, you actually purchase your flight ticket.
This flight may or may not be the same as the flight you report for the reimbursement limit.
%
Finally, you show the receipt of your purchase,
and sponsors will reimburse you the minimum of your actual cost and the reimbursement limit.

Now, you want to figure out your minimum possible \emph{net} cost%
---the price you pay, minus the amount you get reimbursed.
%
Naturally, you will report the price of the most expensive flight ticket and buy the cheapest flight ticket.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input is an integer, $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 50$), the number of available flights.

Each of the next $N$ lines contains an integer $P$ ($10 \leq P \leq 10^5$),
which is the price of a flight ticket from your hometown to Cupcake City, in dollars.
It is guaranteed that $P$ is a multiple of $10$.

\section*{Output}

Output a single integer,
the minimum amount, in dollars, that you have to pay for a flight ticket,
excluding the amount of travel support from sponsors.
