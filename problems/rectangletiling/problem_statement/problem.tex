\problemname{Rectangle Tiling}

Consider a rectangle with integer side lengths.
A square tiling of the rectangle is a covering of the entire region
using non-overlapping squares whose sides are parallel with those of the rectangle. 
In a square tiling, no square may overhang (extend beyond the rectangle's boundary).

You have a collection of squares with side lengths being powers of $2$.
Find a square tiling of the rectangle using the fewest squares possible, or,
indicate that it cannot be done.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains three integers $W, H$ and $N$ ($1 \leq W,H \leq 2^{50}$ and $1 \leq N \leq 51$).
Here, $W$ and $H$ indicate the dimensions of the rectangle. The next line contains $N$ integers $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{N-1}$
where $a_i$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{51}$) is the number of $2^i \times 2^i$ squares you own.

\section*{Output}
If there is a square tiling of a $W \times H$ rectangle using the squares you own, output
the minimum number of squares needed in such a square tiling. Otherwise, output $-1$ if there is no square tiling
of the rectangle using the squares you own.
